## Description

We use React as the front-end core of the dashboard, paired with the Tailwind CSS framework and Syncfusion UI elements. Additionally, we use Google Cloud Firebase as the backend. This web app can query data from Firebase uploaded by the IoT devices on the trail (for example, the number of pedestrians and cyclists) and display it on the website. To configure the IoT device and installation, check the `iot_edge_computing` folder.

## Getting Started

To rebuild the application on your local device, follow these simple steps.

1. Please watch the tutorial first to understand the file structure and how React and Tailwind.css work together.

2. In the project directory, please run: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to install all important packages.

   - `--legacy-peer-deps`: ignore all peerDependencies when installing, in the style of npm version 4 through version 6.
   - `--strict-peer-deps`: fail and abort the install process for any conflicting peerDependencies when encountered. By default, npm will only crash for peerDependencies conflicts caused by the direct dependencies of the root project.
   - `--force`: will force npm to fetch remote resources even if a local copy exists on disk.

3. Setting up your Google Firebase admin API.

4. Type `npm start` to run the web app.

   - Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
   - The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.
