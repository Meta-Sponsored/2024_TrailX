## Description

TrailX is a meta-sponsored and mentored capstone project designed to optimize the management and experience of a 42-mile trail system near Lake Washington. This page displays the web application front-end portion of the current project. We use React as the front-end core for the dashboard, paired with the Tailwind CSS framework and Syncfusion UI components.

Coming Soon: Build a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) Full-Stack web application with complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions.

# Getting Started

To rebuild the application on your local device, follow these simple steps.

1. Please watch the tutorial first to understand the file structure and how React and Tailwind.css work together.

2. In the project directory, please run: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to install all important packages.

   - `--legacy-peer-deps`: ignore all peerDependencies when installing, in the style of npm version 4 through version 6.
   - `--strict-peer-deps`: fail and abort the install process for any conflicting peerDependencies when encountered. By default, npm will only crash for peerDependencies conflicts caused by the direct dependencies of the root project.
   - `--force`: will force npm to fetch remote resources even if a local copy exists on disk.

3. Type `npm start` to run the web app.

   - Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
   - The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.
