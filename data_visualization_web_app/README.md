# Getting Started

1. Please watch the tutorial first to understand the file structure and how React and Tailwind.css work together.

2. In the project directory, please run: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to install all important packages.

   - `--legacy-peer-deps`: ignore all peerDependencies when installing, in the style of npm version 4 through version 6.
   - `--strict-peer-deps`: fail and abort the install process for any conflicting peerDependencies when encountered. By default, npm will only crash for peerDependencies conflicts caused by the direct dependencies of the root project.
   - `--force`: will force npm to fetch remote resources even if a local copy exists on disk.

3. Type `npm start` to run the web app.

   - Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
   - The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.
