# Getting Started

1. Please watch the tutorial first to understand the file structure and how React and Tailwind.css work together.

2. In the project directory, you can run:

`npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

- `--legacy-peer-deps`: ignore all peerDependencies when installing, in the style of npm version 4 through version 6.

- `--strict-peer-deps`: fail and abort the install process for any conflicting peerDependencies when encountered. By default, npm will only crash for peerDependencies conflicts caused by the direct dependencies of the root project.

- `--force`: will force npm to fetch remote resources even if a local copy exists on disk.

## Your Tasks

1. Implement a new page called "News & Map" and put this page in "Pages" of the sidebar.
2. In the "News and Maps" page, try to implement an image carousel and a map that displays the Eastrail route.
3. In the file path "src/data/", how to implement the js code so that when the numbers in "user_counter_output.json" are updated, let "realtime-analysis.js", "monthly-analysis.js" and "monthly" -analysis.js" can be changed simultaneously?

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
