# TrailX — Meta-Sponsored & Mentored Capstone Project | Web Dashboard, IoT Automation (Trail Installation), Computer Vision

## 1. Project Introduction

In a collaborative effort to enhance the [Eastrail](https://eastrail.org/) experience, our team, sponsored and mentored by [Meta](https://gix.uw.edu/consortium/), has embarked on an ambitious project. We're addressing key challenges in user experience, safety, and community engagement along the 42-mile trail system near Lake Washington. Our solution involves a harmonious blend of interactive installations and a web app, aiming to transform the trail into a safer, more engaging, and community-focused space. This initiative is not just about technological innovation; it's about improving the day-to-day interactions of trail users and fostering a more vigorous community connection.

## 4. T-Mobile's IoT Support on Trail Systems

- In addition to Meta’s sponsorship, we traveled to T-Mobile to demo the solution prototype and were provided with a 5G/4G SIM and its support for future deployments.
