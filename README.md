# TrailX â€” Aesthetic IoT & Web App Solution for Trail System | Object Detection-Based Interactive Displays, Python, React, GCP

## 1. Project Introduction

In a collaborative effort to enhance the [Eastrail](https://eastrail.org/) experience, our team, sponsored and mentored by [Meta](https://gix.uw.edu/consortium/), has embarked on an ambitious project. We're addressing key challenges in user experience, safety, and community engagement along the 42-mile trail system near Lake Washington. Our solution involves a harmonious blend of interactive installations and a web app, aiming to transform the trail into a safer, more engaging, and community-focused space. This initiative is not just about technological innovation; it's about improving the day-to-day interactions of trail users and fostering a more vigorous community connection.

It's with a deep sense of appreciation that I extend my heartfelt thanks to [Cloud Qiu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yiyunqiu/) and [Ke Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ke-w-940751100/), whose remarkable talents in device crafting, web design, and insightful user research have been indispensable. My gratitude also flows to [Hon Leung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hon-leung/), whose expertise not only refined the front end of our web page but also seamlessly integrated it with the robust capabilities of Google Cloud Platform. This journey of creation wouldn't have reached its zenith without the collective genius of my team members, to whom I owe a debt of gratitude.

A special note of thanks goes to our sponsor, Meta, for their generous support, and to [Ori Gershony](https://www.linkedin.com/in/origershony/), the Engineering Manager at Meta, whose guidance has been as enlightening as it has been encouraging. Together, we've turned visions into tangible realities; I am eternally grateful for that.
