# TrailX ‚Äî Meta-Sponsored & Mentored Capstone Project | Web Dashboard, IoT Automation (Trail Installation), Computer Vision

### 1. Project Introduction

In a collaborative effort to enhance the [Eastrail](https://eastrail.org/) experience, our team, sponsored and mentored by [Meta](https://gix.uw.edu/consortium/), has embarked on an ambitious project. We're addressing key challenges in user experience, safety, and community engagement along the 42-mile trail system near Lake Washington. Our solution involves a harmonious blend of interactive installations and a web app, aiming to transform the trail into a safer, more engaging, and community-focused space. This initiative is not just about technological innovation; it's about improving the day-to-day interactions of trail users and fostering a more vigorous community connection.

### 2. Current Progress Highlights

- Real-Time Object/User Detection: Successfully implemented on Nvidia Jetson, our system features advanced motion trackers and counters, capable of identifying and counting different trail users such as dog walkers, cyclists, and pedestrians. We've also developed robust speed detection algorithms to enhance safety and user experience.
- Research-Driven Approach: Our development strategy is informed by comprehensive research, including 19 user interviews, the analysis of 1145 survey responses, and consultations with 2 experts. This thorough approach ensures that our solutions are well-aligned with user needs and expectations.

In addition to Meta‚Äôs sponsorship, we traveled to T-Mobile to demo the solution prototype and were provided with a 5G/4G SIM and its support for future deployments.

### 3. Upcoming Developments

- Management Web Dashboard: Currently under development is a sophisticated web dashboard. This tool is designed to effectively manage the trail system, providing real-time data and insights for better oversight and decision-making.
- Solar-Powered IoT Installations: We are in the planning stages to deploy solar-powered IoT interactive installations. These installations will autonomously adjust to varying weather and light conditions, ensuring energy-efficient and sustainable operation.
- Optimization with Full-Stack: Our goal is to leverage full-stack development and data visualization techniques to optimize both the management and the user experience of the trail system. This approach aims to create a seamless integration of technology and nature, enhancing the trail's usability and appeal.
